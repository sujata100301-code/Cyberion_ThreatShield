## 🧠 Detection Engineering

Cyberion ThreatShield uses rule-based detection logic to analyze Windows telemetry.

Detection conditions can evaluate fields such as:

- Event ID
- Process Image
- Command Line
- Parent Process
- Parent Command Line
- Network Protocol
- Destination Port
- Registry activity
- Windows security events

Supported condition operators include:

```text
equals
contains
contains_all
endswith
```

---

## 🛡️ Detection Rules

The project currently contains **20 custom detection rules** covering suspicious Windows activity.

Examples include:

| Rule | Detection |
|---|---|
| 1 | Suspicious Command Shell Spawned by FTP |
| 2 | Windows Failed Logon Attempt |
| 3 | RDP Network Connection |
| 4 | SMB Network Connection |
| 5 | IIS Worker Process Making RDP Connection |
| 6 | Process Spawned by Windows Remote Management Provider |
| 7 | PowerShell Script Block With Base64 Decoding |
| 8 | PowerShell Credential Access via GetNetworkCredential |
| 9 | PowerShell LSASS MiniDumpWriteDump Activity |
| 10 | Scheduled Task Creation Executing Command Shell |
| 11 | Winlogon Shell Registry Modification |
| 12 | PowerShell Execution Policy Changed to Unrestricted |
| 13 | MSHTA Execution of HTA File |
| 14 | Rundll32 PCWUTL LaunchApplication Execution |
| 15 | Command Shell Spawned by WMI Provider |
| 16 | New Windows Service Executing Command Shell |
| 17 | Member Added to Local Administrators Group |
| 18 | Remote Desktop Enabled via Registry |
| 19 | Windows Defender Threat Action Event |
| 20 | Regsvr32 Scrobj DLL Scriptlet Execution |

---

## 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK Integration

Detection alerts can include MITRE ATT&CK technique identifiers to help analysts understand the behavior represented by an alert.

Example:

```text
Rule 14
Rundll32 PCWUTL LaunchApplication Execution

Severity:
MEDIUM

MITRE ATT&CK:
T1218.011
```

This helps connect raw Windows telemetry with standardized adversary behavior.

---

## 🖥️ SOC Dashboard

Cyberion ThreatShield includes a Flask-based SOC dashboard that provides:

- Detection rule status
- EVTX scanner
- Events scanned
- Alerts found
- Detection details
- Severity information
- MITRE ATT&CK information
- Process and command-line evidence
- Recent scan history
- Alert search
- Severity filtering
- Report downloads

### 📸 Dashboard Preview

![Cyberion ThreatShield SOC Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard.png)

---

## 🔍 Example Detection

A Sysmon process creation event containing:

```text
Image:
C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe

CommandLine:
rundll32.exe pcwutl.dll,LaunchApplication
```

can trigger:

```text
Rule 14:
Rundll32 PCWUTL LaunchApplication Execution

MITRE ATT&CK:
T1218.011
```

The detection is then displayed on the web dashboard and included in generated reports.

---

## 📊 Scan History

Cyberion ThreatShield maintains recent scan information including:

- Filename
- Events scanned
- Alerts detected
- Scan timestamp

Scan history is stored locally so that recent scan information can survive Flask server restarts.

Runtime scan-history data is excluded from Git tracking.

---

## 📄 Detection Reports

After analysis, Cyberion ThreatShield can generate:

### JSON Report

Useful for:

- automation
- structured analysis
- integrations
- further processing

### CSV Report

Useful for:

- spreadsheets
- analyst review
- reporting
- filtering and investigation

Reports can be downloaded directly from the dashboard.

## ✅ Validation

The project has been tested using Windows EVTX attack samples.

Development validation includes:

```bash
python -m py_compile src/*.py web/app.py
```

Detection-rule JSON validation:

```bash
python -m json.tool config/detection_rules.json
```

Sigma validation:

```bash
sigma check sigma-rules/
```

The Sigma rules have been validated without rule, condition, or validation errors in the tested project state.

---

## 🧪 Tested Detection Samples

Testing has included telemetry related to:

- Rundll32 execution
- Windows service creation
- Local Administrators group modification
- Remote Desktop configuration
- Windows Defender events
- Regsvr32/scrobj execution

These tests help verify detection behavior against different types of Windows telemetry rather than relying on a single EVTX sample.
