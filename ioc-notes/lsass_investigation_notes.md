## Analyst Notes

The combination of LSASS process access and MiniDumpWriteDump-related

credential-access behavior.

These artifacts should not automatically be treated as confirmed malicious
IOCs. Their legitimacy should be determined using endpoint, user, process,
and organizational context.
